This repository contains my react application which is a graphical interface for [Adzuna API](https://developer.adzuna.com/overview).

I was trying to mock an amazing video from Kyle **Web Dev Simplified** hosted on **Brady Traversy  Channel** but he uses Github Jobs Api which is [deprecated](https://jobs.github.com/) on *April 19, 2021* so I was looking for a good alternative and I ended up choosing Adzuna

I used [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to implement this app, with [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) as requests handler.

it was a great way to learn about react hooks, promises...etc
